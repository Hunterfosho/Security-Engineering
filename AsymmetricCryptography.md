# Asymmetric Cryptography
- RSA - Ron Rivest Adi Shamir, Len Adleman 1977
  - Early asymmetric algorithm
  - Users create RSA key pairs using two large prime numbers
  - Distribute your public key freely, but keep your private key secure
- RSA Keys
  - Sender encrypts message using the recipients public key
  - Recipient decrypts messages using their own private key
- RSA is slow
- RSA is more commonly used to exchange symmetric keys
- RSA patent is expired
# Key Facts about RSA
- Asymmetric encryption algorithm
- Variable length between 1,024 and 4,096 bits
- Considered Secure

# PGP and GnuPG
- Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
  - Created by Phil Zimmerman in 1991
  - Asymmetric algorithm
- OpenPGP
  - Open-source implementation of PGP
- PGP Function
  - Uses public and private keys
  - Combines both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography
- PGP
  - Commerical Product
- GnuPG
  - Available for free
- PGP relies upon other encyption algorithms

# Elliptic curve and quantum cryptography
  - Use new approaches
- Asymmetric cryptography is based upon the difficulty of solving complex math problems
  
# Prime Numbers
- Finding a way to solve the prime factorization problem would break modern cryptography

# Elliptic Curve Cryptograpghy (ECC)
-  Uses the EC discrete log problem
-  Doesn't use prime factorization
  
# Quantum Computing
-  Uses quantum mechanics principles
-  Elliptic curve cryptograpgy can't protect against quantum attacks 
-  Quantum cryptography may be stronger than any modern approach
